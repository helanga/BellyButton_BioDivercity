# BellyButton_BioDivercity

The objective of this project is to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Diversity dataset which catalogs the microbes colonizing human navels.

The dashboard includes:

dropdown to examine data from each individual
bar chart featuring the top ten microbial species (OTUs or operational taxonomic units)
bubble chart featuring all microbial species
gauge of the frequency of belly button washes weekly for each individual
The webpage has three customizations.
When the dashboard is first opened in a browser, ID 940â€™s data should be displayed in the dashboard
All three charts work according to the requirements when a sample is selected from the dropdown menu
